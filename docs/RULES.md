# Rules (94PC)

The rules for this repo's part of the alignment, then the learned rules. Read before every unit. Any tool adds a learned
rule in the same commit as the fix that confirmed it, newest last: `- YYYY-MM-DD <area>: <rule>. (<evidence>)`.

## Who decides what (all games)

| Category | Decided by |
|---|---|
| Name of a routine several games share | the earliest game that has it (92G is the root); a fix goes to the earliest repo first, then down the lineage |
| Name of a feature new in year N | that year's Genesis game (94G for 94S and 94PC, 95G for 95S and 95PC) |
| Name of a platform-only job | the earlier repo on that platform (93S for 94S, 94PC for 95PC), else what the code does |
| Same name, different job | the earlier meaning keeps the name |
| Top folder or file | the same-year Genesis file |
| RAM order | the merged order (92G, 93G, 94G, 93S, 94S, then 95G, 96G) |
| Data, assets, banks | the earlier repo on the same platform |
| Order inside a file | ROM order (the report re-sorts for display) |
| History | `docs/name_map.csv` only, never source comments |

## This repo

- Names: the 94G name when the body matches. Parts taken from the SNES ports use the 93S or 94S name. A DOS job uses the 95PC name for the same job, else MSC/EACLIB names from the error strings.
- Layout: alignment of files waits until the overlays are disassembled.
